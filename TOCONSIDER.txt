TO CONSIDER

fir future development


----------

Move physics to Python module, run it on Raspberry PI(s)

----------

Move sound design part into a different module, build it on a modular
principle. Every time a World object is created, it should build the hierarchy
of all defined Groups, Nodes, Synths and Buses for a defined synth.
